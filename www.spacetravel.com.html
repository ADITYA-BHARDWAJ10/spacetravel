<h1><MARQUEE>SOLAR SYSTEM</MARQUEE></h1>
<h4><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/">SOLAR SYSTEM!</a></h4>

<H3><p><I>The Solar System is made up of all the planets that orbit our Sun.
 In addition to planets, the Solar System also consists of moons, comets, asteroids, minor planets, dust and gas.
 The inner solar system contains the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.<br> The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. 
The planets of the outer solar system are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune (Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet).
Everything in the Solar System orbits or revolves around the Sun.<br> The Sun contains around 98% of all the material in the Solar System.
 The larger an object is, the more gravity it has. Because the Sun is so large, its powerful gravity attracts all the other objects in the Solar System towards it.
 At the same time, these objects, which are moving very rapidly, try to fly away from the Sun, outward into the emptiness of outer space
The result of the planets trying to fly away, at the same time that the Sun is trying to pull them inward is that they become trapped half-way in between.<br>
 Balanced between flying towards the Sun and escaping into space, they spend eternity orbiting around their parent star.<br>

The Planets orbit in the same direction (counter-clockwise looking down from above the Sun’s North Pole);
all but Venus, Uranus and Pluto also rotate in that same sense. 
Mercury has the fastest elliptical orbit,48 km per second. It has the shortest revolution at 88 days. Pluto has an orbital speed of 5 km per second. 
It takes 248 years for Pluto to make one complete revolution.</I></p></H3>

<MARQUEE><H1>GALAXIES</H1></MARQUEE>
<h3><I>A galaxy is a group of many stars, with gas, dust, and dark matter.[1][2][3][4] The name 'galaxy' is taken from the Greek word galaxia meaning milky, a reference to our own galaxy, the Milky Way.<br>

Gravity holds galaxies together against the general expansion of the universe.[3] In effect, the expansion of the universe takes place between groups of galaxies, not inside those groups.<br> Gravity holds the galaxy together. The same applies to groups and clusters of galaxies, such as our Local Group where the Milky Way is, and the Virgo Cluster, a collection of more than 1,000 (might even be 2,000) galaxies.<br> The gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies. Everything in a galaxy moves around a centre of mass, which is also an effect of gravity.<br>

There are various types of galaxies: elliptical, spiral and lenticular galaxies, which can all be with or without bars. Then there are irregular galaxies.<br> All galaxies exist inside the universe. The observable Universe contains more than 2 trillion (1012) galaxies[5] and, overall, as many as an estimated 1×1024 stars[6][7] (more stars than all the grains of sand on planet Earth).[8]<br>

<h1><MARQUEE>UNKNOWN UNIVERSE</MARQUEE></h1>

<h3><p><I>The Universe is everything we can touch, feel, sense, measure or detect.
 It includes living things, planets, stars, galaxies, dust clouds, light, and even time.
 Before the birth of the Universe, time, space and matter did not exist.<br>

The Universe contains billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars. The space between the stars and galaxies is largely empty.
 However, even places far from stars and planets contain scattered particles of dust or a few hydrogen atoms per cubic centimeter. 
Space is also filled with radiation (e.g. light and heat), magnetic fields and high energy particles (e.g. cosmic rays).<br>


The Universe is incredibly huge. It would take a modern jet fighter more than a million years to reach the nearest star to the Sun.
 Travelling at the speed of light (300,000 km per second), it would take 100,000 years to cross our Milky Way galaxy alone.<br>


No one knows the exact size of the Universe, because we cannot see the edge – if there is one.
 All we do know is that the visible Universe is at least 93 billion light years across.
 (A light year is the distance light travels in one year – about 9 trillion km.)<br>


The Universe has not always been the same size. Scientists believe it began in a Big Bang, which took place nearly 14 billion years ago.
 Since then, the Universe has been expanding outward at very high speed.
 So the area of space we now see is billions of times bigger than it was when the Universe was very young.
 The galaxies are also moving further apart as the space between them expands.<br></I></p></h3>
